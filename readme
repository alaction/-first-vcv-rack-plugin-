this plugin will try six things, I will work on them separately, then compile thhem together later.
First, use the qzsedftgyhujkolpm keys to make an input for a monophonic keyboard.
second, use the same keys for a polyphonic one
third, use most of the keyboard in an accordeon-shaped pattern for a monophonic voice
fourth, use the same key for a plyphonic voice, but each key is one note
fifth,use same keys for chords, each key being a chord, but only one key activated at the same time.
last, use keys for chords and multiple keys being usable at the same time.
